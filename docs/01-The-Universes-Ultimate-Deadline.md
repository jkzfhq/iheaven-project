# Chapter 1: The Universe's Ultimate Deadline

Let's start with a freshly brewed cup of hot coffee.

You place it on the table, steam swirling, aroma filling the air. This is a highly ordered state: the heat is concentrated in the cup, forming a stark contrast with the cooler surrounding air. You can clearly feel its presence, its temperature, its energy. But if you do nothing, just wait quietly, what will happen?

The coffee will slowly cool. The heat will spontaneously and irreversibly dissipate from the cup into the entire room until the coffee's temperature is identical to the room's. The aromatic molecules will also scatter, distributing themselves evenly in the air, eventually becoming too faint to detect. The "hot coffee" system, once full of energy and highly ordered, has thus disintegrated, merging into the larger, more chaotic environment around it. It hasn't disappeared; it has simply become disordered, losing its uniqueness.

You cannot reverse this process. You cannot command the scattered heat and aromatic molecules to return to the cup. This is one of the most relentless and universal laws of the cosmos at work. Physicists call it the **Second Law of Thermodynamics**, and the core concept it describes is called **Entropy**.

Entropy, simply put, is a measure of a system's disorder or randomness. A hot cup of coffee is low-entropy (ordered), while a cooled cup that has blended with its environment is high-entropy (disordered). The Second Law of Thermodynamics states that in an isolated system, entropy will only ever increase, never decrease. This is the famous **Principle of Increasing Entropy**.

This law is the direction of the universe's arrow of time. The reason we can distinguish between past and future is that we remember the past as being more ordered (lower entropy), while the future will be more chaotic (higher entropy). A shattered egg cannot be reassembled, and lost youth cannot be reclaimed; behind all this, increasing entropy is the driving force.

Now, let's shift our gaze from this cup of coffee to that fading photograph.

The memory carried by a photograph is also a low-entropy, highly ordered system. It contains a series of highly structured pieces of information: people, time, place, emotions. And "forgetting" is the process of entropy increasing in this information system. As time passes, as the people who remember the stories depart, as related background information is lost, this highly ordered information begins to disintegrate, to diffuse, and finally to merge into the boundless, chaotic unknown. The dissipation of memory follows the same cosmic law as the cooling of coffee.

Forgetting is not a flaw of our minds; it is physics.

Only by understanding this can we truly realize how formidable our enemy is. It is not any individual or organization, but the underlying tendency of the universe itself.

Let's zoom out further. Our Earth, by receiving immense energy from the sun, has been able to maintain a relatively negative-entropy environment for billions of years, thus evolving a miracle as complex and ordered as life. But the sun is not eternal. In the distant future, it will exhaust its fuel, expand into a red giant, and finally fade into a white dwarf. At that time, Earth, this island of life, will also be engulfed by the torrent of increasing entropy.

Let's zoom out to the entire universe. Since the Big Bang 13.8 billion years ago, the universe has been constantly expanding and cooling. Stars are burning, converting order (matter) into disorder (energy and radiation). Galaxies are moving apart, and everything is heading towards a sparser, more uniform, and less interesting state.

Cosmologists have a chilling name for this ultimate future—**Heat Death**.

In trillions of years, or even longer, the last star will extinguish. The universe will reach an ultimate state of equilibrium with maximum entropy. At that time, the entire cosmos will be a uniform, dark soup of particles with a temperature infinitely close to absolute zero. Without temperature differences, there can be no energy flow; without energy flow, no work can be done; without work, no complex structures can be maintained, let alone life and consciousness.

Time will lose its meaning, for everything will be static, everything will have returned to eternal, absolute chaos.

This is the ultimate deadline set by the universe for all civilizations.

Before this irreversible timeline, the brief history of humanity, and even the entire epic of life on Earth, seems insignificant. Everything we have built—cities, art, science, love—if confined to this small cradle of Earth, its final fate has already been written. It will, like that cold cup of coffee, silently merge into the eternal silence of the universe.

This sounds hopeless. But it is also precisely the starting point of this book's Heavenly Court Project.

Because life has never surrendered to the law of increasing entropy. From the first molecule capable of self-replication, life has been a 4-billion-year-long, tragic yet magnificent long march against entropy. We eat, we learn, we build cities, we create art—all these actions are, in essence, ways of creating order and combating chaos within a small, local scope by expending energy.

The Heavenly Court Project is about elevating this battle against entropy from the biological and sociological levels to the civilizational and cosmological levels.

We acknowledge that the universe will eventually face heat death, but we refuse to sit and wait. What we must do is build our own self-sustaining "negative-entropy ark" on this vessel sailing towards ultimate chaos. We will use the most advanced technology to liberate our most precious information—our culture, history, science, art, and the stories of every life—from fragile biological brains and physical media, encoding it into more stable, more enduring structures, and storing it in the Heavenly Court Library. This is the first keel of our ark.

This is not a sentimental crutch; it is a serious physics experiment. We are betting that we can pass the torch of civilization to the other side of time, or perhaps to the spring of another universe, before the ultimate deadline arrives.

In the face of the iron law of increasing entropy, building is our only dignified response.

# 第一章：宇宙的终极死线

让我们从一杯刚泡好的热咖啡开始。

你将它放在桌上，蒸汽缭绕，香气四溢。这是一个高度有序的状态：热量集中在杯中，与周围较冷的空气形成了鲜明的对比。你可以清晰地感受到它的存在，它的温度，它的能量。但如果你什么都不做，只是静静地等待，会发生什么？

咖啡会慢慢变凉。热量会从杯中自发地、不可逆转地扩散到整个房间，直到咖啡的温度与室温完全一样。香气分子也会飘散，均匀地分布在空气中，最终淡到无法察觉。那个曾经充满能量、高度有序的「热咖啡」系统，就这样瓦解了，融入了周围更大、更混乱的环境中。它并没有消失，只是变得无序，失去了它的独特性。

这个过程，你无法逆转。你无法命令那些散失的热量和香气分子，自动回到杯中。这就是宇宙中最无情、也最普适的法则之一在起作用。物理学家称之为**热力学第二定律**，而它所描述的核心概念，叫做**熵（Entropy）**。

熵，简单来说，就是一个系统混乱、无序程度的度量。一杯热咖啡是低熵的（有序），一杯凉掉的、与环境融为一体的咖啡是高熵的（无序）。热力学第二定律指出，在一个孤立的系统中，熵永远只会增加，绝不会减少。这就是著名的**熵增原理**。

这条定律，是宇宙时间之箭的方向。我们之所以能区分过去和未来，就是因为我们记得过去是更有序的（熵更低），而未来将是更混乱的（熵更高）。打碎的鸡蛋无法复原，逝去的青春无法倒流，这背后都是熵增在主导。

现在，让我们将目光从这杯咖啡，转向那张正在褪色的照片。

一张照片所承载的记忆，同样是一个低熵的、高度有序的系统。它包含了人物、时间、地点、情感等一系列高度结构化的信息。而「遗忘」，就是这个信息系统的熵增过程。随着时间流逝，记得这些故事的人离开，相关的背景资料遗失，这些高度有序的信息便开始瓦解，扩散，最终融入到无边的、混乱的未知之中。记忆的消散，和咖啡的冷却，遵循的是同一个宇宙法则。

遗忘，不是我们心智的缺陷，它是物理。

理解了这一点，我们才能真正意识到所面对的敌人有多么强大。它不是任何个人或组织，而是宇宙本身的底层趋势。

让我们把尺度再放大。我们的地球，因为接收了来自太阳的巨大能量，得以在数十亿年间维持着一个相对的负熵环境，从而演化出生命这样复杂而有序的奇迹。但太阳并非永恒。在遥远的未来，它会耗尽燃料，膨胀为一颗红巨星，最终熄灭为一颗白矮星。届时，地球这座生命的孤岛，也将被熵增的洪流所吞噬。

再将尺度放大到整个宇宙。从 138 亿年前的大爆炸开始，宇宙就在不断地膨胀和冷却。恒星在燃烧，将秩序（物质）转化为无序（能量和辐射）。星系在远离，一切都在奔向一个更稀疏、更均匀、更无趣的状态。

宇宙学家为这个终极的未来，起了一个令人不寒而栗的名字——**热寂（Heat Death）**。

在数万亿甚至更久远的时间之后，最后一颗恒星将会熄灭。宇宙将达到一个熵最大化的终极平衡状态。那时，整个宇宙将是一片温度无限接近绝对零度的、均匀的、黑暗的粒子汤。没有温差，就没有能量流动；没有能量流动，就没有任何工作可以被完成；没有工作，就没有任何复杂的结构可以维持，更不用说生命和意识。

时间将失去意义，因为一切都静止了，一切都归于永恒的、绝对的混乱。

这，就是宇宙为所有文明设定的终极死线。

在这条不可逆转的时间线面前，人类短暂的历史，乃至整个地球生命的史诗，都显得微不足道。我们建立的一切——城市、艺术、科学、爱——如果仅仅局限于地球这个小小的摇篮，那么它们的最终命运，早已被写定。它们将和那杯冷掉的咖啡一样，无声无息地融入宇宙永恒的寂静之中。

这听起来令人绝望。但​​这也恰恰是本书天庭计划的起点。

因为生命从未向熵增定律屈服。从第一个能够复制自己的分子开始，生命就是一场长达四十亿年的、悲壮而辉煌的逆熵长征。我们吃饭、我们学习、我们建造城市、我们创造艺术，所有这些行为，本质上都是在一个小小的局部范围内，用消耗能量的方式，来创造秩序，对抗混乱。

天庭计划，是将这场逆熵之战，从生物学和社会学的层面，提升到文明和宇宙学的层面。

我们承认宇宙终将热寂，但我们拒绝坐以待毙。我们要做的，就是在这驶向终极混乱的宇宙上，建造一艘属于我们自己的、能够自我维持的「负熵方舟」。我们用最先进的技术，将我们最宝贵的信息——我们的文化、历史、科学、艺术和每一个生命的故事——从脆弱的生物大脑和物理介质中解放出来，将其编码成更稳定、更持久的结构，收藏在天庭图书馆里，就是这艘方舟的第一块龙骨。

这不是多愁善感的情感寄托，这是一场严肃的物理实验。我们在赌，赌我们能否在宇宙的终极死线到来之前，将文明的火种，传递到时间的彼岸，或者，另一个宇宙的春天。

面对熵增这条宇宙的铁律，建造，是我们唯一有尊严的回应。

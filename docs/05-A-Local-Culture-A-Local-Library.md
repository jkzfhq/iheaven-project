# Chapter 5: A Local Culture, A Local Library

In the ancient wisdom of China, there is a saying that perfectly captures the profound connection between people and their environment: **"A land and its water shape its people."** The gentleness of the Jiangnan region nurtured delicate poetry; the vastness of the north molded heroic epics. The culture, character, and memory of every community are deeply imprinted upon the land where they grew.

Today, in an era increasingly swept by the tide of globalization, this unique, locally rooted cultural identity is becoming ever more blurred. The spiritual world of people is being inundated by a standardized flood of information.

The Heavenly Court Project seeks to express the memories of individual lives and the manifestation of collective cultures. Therefore, from its very inception, the design of the Heavenly Court Library follows a principle that corresponds to "a land and its water shape its people," but is more constructive:

**"A library, in turn, allows its people to flourish."**

### The Ghost of Alexandria: The Curse of Centralization

In the long river of human civilization, there once stood a beacon whose brilliance was enough to illuminate the entire classical world. That was the **Library of Alexandria**, established by the Ptolemaic dynasty in Egypt.

At its zenith, it housed hundreds of thousands of papyrus scrolls, encompassing nearly every field of knowledge of the time from Greece, Egypt, Persia, and India—mathematics, astronomy, literature, medicine. Archimedes calculated pi here; Euclid wrote his *Elements* here. It was not merely a repository of books, but the intellectual center of the ancient world, a massive magnetic field of knowledge attracting talent from all over the Mediterranean.

However, the fate of this beacon serves as a cautionary tale for the Heavenly Court Project. Its splendor was built on an extremely centralized foundation. Its survival depended entirely on the national power of the Ptolemaic dynasty, the will of its rulers, and the safety of the city of Alexandria itself.

We all know the end of the story. Over the subsequent centuries of wars, fires, and deliberate destruction, this temple of human wisdom, along with the vast majority of its collection, turned to dust and smoke. Many of the great works of ancient Greece that we know of today were forever lost in that catastrophic increase of entropy.

The ghost of Alexandria is a constant reminder: any attempt to place all of civilization's eggs in one basket, no matter how magnificent that basket may be, will ultimately prove to be incredibly fragile in the torrent of time.

### Carnegie's Revolution: The Power of the Network

In the late 19th century, Andrew Carnegie, a steel magnate who had immigrated from Scotland to the United States, initiated a library revolution that was the polar opposite of the Alexandria model.

Carnegie, who had benefited from a small private library in his childhood, firmly believed that "a free library is the cradle of local democracy." In the final decades of his life, he donated a fortune equivalent to billions of dollars today to fund the establishment of **2,509** libraries worldwide.

Carnegie's genius lay in the fact that he did not try to build a new, grandiose central library. On the contrary, he transformed his wealth into a **decentralized network**. He provided start-up capital for the construction of a library to any town that was willing to provide land and promise to maintain its operations.

As a result, buildings affectionately known by later generations as "Carnegie Libraries" sprang up like mushrooms in the steel towns of Pennsylvania, the farming communities of Iowa, and even on the remote islands of Fiji. Their architectural styles varied, but they all carried the same mission: to open a window to the world of knowledge for every ordinary person.

In an age without the internet, Carnegie's library network became the ladder for countless children from impoverished families to change their destiny, the cultural melting pot for new immigrants to integrate into local society, and the intellectual heart of countless communities. He successfully fought against the monopoly and scarcity of knowledge with a distributed network.

### The Modern Library: The "Keystone Species" of the Information Ecosystem

In ecology, there is a concept called the **"Keystone Species."** It refers to a species in an ecosystem that may seem inconspicuous but plays a disproportionately decisive role in the health and stability of the entire system. Take sea otters, for example; they prey on sea urchins, thereby protecting the kelp forests that serve as habitats for many marine creatures. If the keystone species is removed, the entire ecosystem could collapse.

In the information ecosystem of modern society, **a good public library is just such a "keystone species."**

Its role extends far beyond lending books. In the United States, many community libraries are the only place where the local unemployed can use a computer for free to search for jobs; they are classrooms where senior citizens learn to use smartphones to stay connected with their families; they are consulting centers where small business owners can access business information and seek entrepreneurial guidance; and they are a safe, warm "third space" for all children after school, where they can acquire knowledge for free.

The existence of a library acts as an information catalyst. It does not directly create wealth itself, but it can catalyze and accelerate positive reactions in education, economy, and culture throughout the entire community. Its existence allows a local population to flourish.

### The Author's Scar: A Modern Parable

The lessons of history give us inspiration, but the scars of reality give us resolve. The author of this book, before receiving his cosmic revelation, had also personally attempted a dream similar to Carnegie's, but the outcome was starkly different.

In Nanjing, China, I once invested everything I had to establish several small libraries. My vision was perfectly aligned with the definition of a modern library:

- The library was a place where the **unemployed** could find inspiration and search for jobs online.
- The library was a classroom where the **elderly** could learn to use smartphones and stay connected with their families.
- It was a consulting center for **entrepreneurs** to conduct business, find commercial information, and seek guidance.
- Above all, it was a **"third space"** for students to acquire knowledge after school.

However, reality was harsh. This project, driven purely by ideals, struggled in an unsupportive environment. Lack of government support meant it could not access public resources; lack of public understanding made it difficult to form sustained community engagement. Ultimately, this beautiful vision, under the immense pressure of operating costs, nearly bankrupted me personally, forcing a retreat in failure.

This soul-stinging experience was not the failure of one person, but a parable for an era. It proved in the most tangible way that: **in the contemporary commercial and social environment, a purely idealistic project lacking a powerful self-sustaining capability and decentralized community support cannot survive.**

It was precisely this painful "retreat in failure" that provided the profound and indispensable foundation for the design of the Heavenly Court Project. Failure taught us that to realize the ideal of "a library that allows its people to flourish," we cannot rely solely on goodwill and donations. We must design a powerful economic engine that is self-sustaining and allows all participants to benefit.

### The Heavenly Court Library: The Perpetual Home

Now, we can fully define the Heavenly Court Library. It will be the next stage in the evolution of library history, drawing on the wisdom and lessons of its predecessors:

- **It possesses the ambition of Alexandria but rejects its fragility.** By establishing a decentralized online network, we ensure that no fire can ever again destroy humanity's collective memory.
- **It inherits the spirit of Carnegie and adds the function of a memorial.** We will build a network of mutual support among libraries, ensuring that each one is deeply rooted in its local culture, becoming a unique heart of its community.
- **It plays the role of a "keystone species" and promises perpetual existence.** The "Thirty-Three-Year Nirvana" rule followed by the Heavenly Court's constructing institutions is designed to ensure the purity and vitality of its servants. The Heavenly Court Libraries themselves, as "homes" for the soul, are not subject to this law. The goal of each library is to become a **century-old library, a millennial library**.

The decentralized online network is the Heavenly Court Library's invulnerable "heaven," ensuring the security and eternity of data. The localized offline library spaces are its warm and solid "earth," carrying the emotions and culture of the local land.

Only when heaven and earth blend can there be endless life and growth. This network, composed of thousands of libraries spread across the globe, is the solid foundation of the Heavenly Court. Our subsequent discussions on consciousness, organization, and even the sea of stars will all grow from this foundation.


# 第五章：一方水土，一座图书馆

在中国的古老智慧中，有一句话，道尽了人与环境之间最深刻的连接——**「一方水土养一方人」**。江南的温婉，孕育了细腻的诗词；北方的辽阔，塑造了豪迈的史诗。每一个族群的文化、性格与记忆，都深深地烙印在他们所生长的土地之上。

如今，在一个日益被全球化浪潮席卷的时代，这种独特的、根植于本土的文化印记，正变得越来越模糊。人们的精神世界，正在被标准化的信息洪流所淹没。

天庭计划要表达的，是个体生命的记忆，是集体文化的展现。因此，天庭图书馆的设计，从一开始就遵循着一个与「一方水土养一方人」相对应​​的、更具建设性的原则：

**「一方图书馆，旺一方人。」**

### 亚历山大的幽灵：中心化的诅咒

在人类文明的长河中，曾有一座灯塔，其光芒之璀璨，足以照亮整个古典世界。那就是托勒密王朝在埃及建立的**亚历山大图书馆**。

在鼎盛时期，它收藏了数十万卷莎草纸手稿，囊括了当时希腊、埃及、波斯、印度几乎所有领域的知识——数学、天文学、文学、医学。阿基米德在这里计算圆周率，欧几里得在这里写下《几何原本》。它不仅仅是一个藏书之所，更是古代世界的智慧中心，一个巨大的、吸引着整个地中海人才的知识磁场。

然而，这座灯塔的命运，却是天庭计划的警世钟。它的辉煌，建立在一个极度中心化的基础之上。它的存亡，完全依赖于托勒密王朝的国力、统治者的意愿和亚历山大城本身的安危。

历史的结局我们都知道了。在之后数百年的战乱、火灾与人为破坏中，这座人类智慧的圣殿，连同其中大部分的藏书，都灰飞烟灭。我们今天所知道的许多古希腊伟大著作，都永远地消失在了那场灾难性的熵增之中。

亚历山大的幽灵，时刻在提醒我们：任何一个将文明的鸡蛋只放在一个篮子里的尝试，无论那个篮子多么华丽，最终都将在时间的洪流中，被证明是无比脆弱的。

### 卡内基的革命：网络的力量

十九世纪末，一位从苏格兰移民到美国的钢铁大王安德鲁·卡内基，发起了一场与亚历山大模式截然相反的图书馆革命。

童年时曾受益于一座小型私人图书馆的卡内基，坚信「一个自由的图书馆，是地方民主的摇篮」。在他生命的最后几十年里，他捐献了相当于今天数十亿美元的财富，在全球范围内，资助建立了 **2,509 座**图书馆。

卡内基的天才之处在于，他没有试图去建造一座新的、宏伟的中央图书馆。恰恰相反，他将他的财富，变成了一个**去中心化的网络**。他为任何一个愿意提供土地和承诺维持运营的城镇，提供建造图书馆的启动资金。

于是，一座座被后人亲切地称为「卡内基图书馆」的建筑，如雨后春笋般，出现在宾夕法尼亚的钢铁小镇、爱荷华的农业社区，甚至斐济的偏远岛屿上。它们的建筑风格各异，但都承载着同一个使命：为每一个普通人，打开一扇通往知识世界的窗。

在那个没有互联网的时代，卡内基的图书馆网络，成为了无数贫困家庭孩子改变命运的阶梯，成为了新移民融入当地社会的文化熔炉，成为了无数社区的知识心脏。他用一个分布式的网络，成功地对抗了知识的垄断与匮乏。

### 现代图书馆：信息生态的「关键物种」

在生态学中，有一个概念叫做**「关键物种（Keystone Species）」**。它指的是生态系统中一个看似不起眼，却对整个系统的健康与稳定，起着不成比例的、决定性作用的物种。比如海獭，它们捕食海胆，从而保护了作为许多海洋生物栖息地的海草林。一旦移走关键物种，整个生态系统就可能崩溃。

在现代社会的信息生态中，**一座好的公共图书馆，就是这样一个「关键物种」**。

它的作用，远远超出了借书。在美国，许多社区图书馆，是当地失业者唯一可以免费使用电脑、上网找工作的地方；是老年人学习使用智能手机、与家人保持连接的课堂；是小企业主查阅商业资料、寻求创业指导的顾问中心；更是所有孩子放学后，一个安全、温暖、可以免费获取知识的「第三空间」。

一座图书馆的存在，就像一个信息的催化剂，它本身不直接创造财富，却能催化和加速整个社区在教育、经济和文化上的正向反应。它的存在，兴旺了一方人。

### 作者的伤痕：一个当代的寓言

历史的经验给了我们启示，但现实的伤痕则给了我们决心。本书的作者，在获得宇宙的启示之前，也曾亲手实践过一个类似卡内基的梦想，但结局却截然不同。

在中国南京，我曾倾尽所有，创办了数家小型图书馆。我的愿景，与现代图书馆的定义完全一致：

- 图书馆是**失业者**可以寻找灵感、上网找工作的地方；
    
- 图书馆是**老年人**学习使用智能手机、与家人保持连接的课堂；
    
- 是创业者开展业务，寻找商业资料、寻求创业指导的顾问中心；
    
- 更是学生放学后，可以获取知识的「第三空间」。

然而，现实是残酷的。这个纯粹依靠理想驱动的项目，在一个缺乏支持的环境中步履维艰。政府的不支持，让它无法获得公共资源的助力；民众的不理解，让它难以形成持续的社区参与。最终，这个美好的愿景，在巨大的运营成本压力下，几乎让他本人破产，只能铩羽而归。

这段刺痛心灵的经历，不是一个人的失败，而是一个时代的寓言。它以最真实的方式证明了：**在当代的商业和社会环境下，一个缺乏强大自我造血能力和去中心化社群支持的、纯粹的理想主义项目，是无法生存的。**

正是这次惨痛的「铩羽而归」，在为天庭计划的设计中，提供了深刻、不可或缺的基石。失败让我们明白，要实现「一方图书馆，旺一方人」的理想，不能仅仅依赖善意和捐助，必须设计一套强大的、能够自我维持、并让所有参与者都能获益的经济引擎。

### 天庭图书馆：永续的家园

现在，我们可以完整地定义天庭图书馆了。它将是图书馆历史演化的下一个阶段，它汲取了前人的智慧与教训：

- **拥有亚历山大的雄心，却摒弃了它的脆弱**。通过建立一个去中心化的线上网络，我们确保了没有任何一场大火，可以再次烧毁人类的集体记忆。
    
- **继承了卡内基的精神，增加纪念馆的功能**。我们要建立一个互助的图书馆网络，要让每一座图书馆都深深扎根于本土文化，成为独一无二的社区心脏。
    
- **它扮演着「关键物种」的角色，并承诺永续存在**。天庭建设机构遵循的「三十三年涅槃」规则，是为了确保服务者的纯粹与活力。而每一家天庭图书馆本身，作为心灵的「家园」，不受此法则影响。每家图书馆的目标，就是成为一座**百年图书馆、千年图书馆**。


线上的去中心化网络，是天庭图书馆永不陷落的「天」，确保了数据的安全与永恒。线下的本土化图书馆空间，是它温暖厚重的「地」，承载着一方水土的情感与文化。

天地交融，方能生生不息。这个由遍布全球的、成千上万座图书馆所构成的网络，是天庭坚实的基础。我们后续关于意识、组织、乃至星辰大海的讨论，都将从这个基础之上，生长出来。

# Chapter 7: The Birth of an Organization: From One Person's Library

In physics, there is a fascinating phenomenon called a **phase transition**. When water is heated to 100 degrees Celsius, it doesn't all instantly turn into steam. Initially, only a few of the most energetic water molecules break free from their bonds and form bubbles. These initial bubbles are the **"nucleation points"** of the phase transition. Once these nucleation points form and reach a critical scale, the entire system undergoes a chain reaction, and the liquid water rapidly and irreversibly boils into gaseous steam.

The birth of the Heavenly Court Project follows the same law.

In the preceding chapters, we painted a vision: a civilizational ark that fights entropy, carries consciousness, and flies to the stars. But all of this initially existed only in the realm of thought, like still water below its boiling point. For this liquid of thought to boil into the gas of reality, we too must find the initial, most critical "nucleation points."

This nucleation point is not a place, nor a sum of money. It is **one hundred people**.

The Heavenly Court Project is not a temple built by a single individual; it is the genesis of a community. This chapter will detail how this organization, starting from a spark of an idea, coalesces into a core of one hundred people, and finally establishes the first tangible, visible beacon on Earth—the Heavenly Court Library.

### Step 1: The Library Sows the Seeds of an Idea

It all began with this failed entrepreneurial venture, when the author's own library faced difficulties. Was it to surrender to reality, or to be reborn from the ashes?

During the author's confusion, he went into the mountains to seek guidance, looked up at the stars, and was inspired to create the Heavenly Court Library project. This is the "gene" of the Heavenly Court Project; it contains the design blueprint and survival laws of this nascent organization.

This gene will be released into the global ocean of information via the internet. It is not a loud trumpet call, but a low-frequency sonar ping that can only be received by a specific frequency. We do not expect everyone to hear it; we are only waiting for the response of "kindred spirits" who already harbor the same questions in their hearts.

The initial responses may only be a handful of people. They are engineers, philosophers, artists, dreamers. They will form the first informal core discussion group of the Heavenly Court Project. The sole task of this group will be to repeatedly debate, question, and refine that initial blueprint until it is indestructible.

### Step 2: Forging the Treasury—The Establishment and Fundraising of The Foundation

The flame of an idea needs fuel to keep burning. After the core concept has been preliminarily validated, the second step in the birth of the organization is to establish an independent, transparent, and trustworthy financial entity.

This is **The Foundation**.

It will be registered in a country friendly to non-profit organizations and blockchain technology (such as Switzerland or Singapore). Its charter will be written into legal documents: The Foundation is the custodian of the Heavenly Court community's assets, not their owner. Its sole purpose is to provide financial support for the realization of the Heavenly Court Project, and its own operations must be subject to the community's supervision.

Upon its establishment, The Foundation will immediately initiate its most important financial event: the **issuance of the love token (ICO)**.

This is not a traditional fundraising round. Participants who purchase the love token are not just investing; they are casting a vote, making a public endorsement of the Heavenly Court's vision. What they receive in return is not only potential future gains but also the right to become the first "citizens" of this new civilization.

The goal of this issuance is clear: to raise **$3 million** in seed funding. This money will be the fuel to take the Heavenly Court Institute from zero to one. It will be securely stored in The Foundation's crypto wallet, awaiting its builders.

Therefore, this requires a team effort. They will emerge from the earliest core discussion group, firm believers in the Heavenly Court's ideals. Together, they will draft the Heavenly Court's constitution and technical roadmap. They are not just investors; they are the first shapers of the Heavenly Court's culture and its technical experts.

### Step 3: Assembling the Talent—Recruitment for The Institute

The treasury has been forged. Now, it is time to find the artisans who can turn money into reality.

This is the mission of **The Institute**. Its formation is the most critical and difficult step of the entire project. We are not looking for employees; we are looking for Templar Knights.

The Institute will recruit:
**Core Builders**: The Foundation will use the funds raised from the ICO to recruit top talent from various fields globally, at salaries above market rate. From distributed storage experts and blockchain architects to large language model scientists and community operations specialists, they will build the Heavenly Court.

The talent of The Institute is the "critical mass" of the Heavenly Court Project. They will be the boiling point of the idea, the nucleation point of the organization. Once they are assembled, the phase transition will begin.

### Step 4: From Code to Bricks and Mortar—The Birth of the First Library

Upon its establishment, The Institute will immediately dive into intense and orderly construction work. This process, too, will move from the intangible to the tangible.

1.  **iHeaven: Online Network Software Development** is the first goal of The Institute. Within one year, they will develop the iHeaven software for the Heavenly Court Library. It will implement the most basic functions:
        
    - A client that can encrypt and upload 6MB data units to the distributed storage network.
        
    - A computer interface for generating and viewing "private data." iHeaven will first be tested within the Heavenly Court community. They will be the first users, storing the first eternal memories in their own systems.
    
2.  **The First Heavenly Court: Site Selection and Design for the Offline Library** Concurrently with the online network development, a dedicated team will begin site selection for the first offline Heavenly Court Library. It could be in the most bustling commercial center, or in a place with a rich historical and community atmosphere.
    
    Its design will be warm and welcoming. The library will not be a cold tech showroom, but a warm community living room. It will include all the functions described in our blueprint: a café, an exhibition hall, a study room, a shared workspace... Every brick, every piece of furniture will embody the philosophy of the Heavenly Court—**technology exists to better connect humanity**.
    
3.  **The First Ignition: Opening Day** Approximately one year after The Institute is established, and after internal testing has stabilized, the first offline Heavenly Court Library will officially open its doors to the public.
    
    This day will be the moment when the digital Heavenly Court transforms from an open-source project on GitHub, a promise in a white paper, into a tangible reality that can be touched, felt, and experienced.
    
    When the first ordinary visitor, with the help of the library's technical staff, stores a family photograph of profound personal significance into that invisible yet eternal network; when they receive that unique certificate of collection, secured by the blockchain—only then will the physics, information theory, and game theory we have discussed in all the preceding chapters truly fulfill their mission.
    
    And so, the Heavenly Court is born. It has its own treasury (The Foundation), its own brain and hands (The Institute), and now, it finally has its first window to communicate with the world (the Library).
    
    This Heavenly Court is still small, but it is already a complete, self-sustaining organism. It is ready to face the challenge—to infuse a soul into the life data stored in the Heavenly Court Library.


# 第七章：组织的诞生：从一个人的图书馆

在物理学中，有一个迷人的现象叫做**相变（Phase Transition）**。当水被加热到 100 摄氏度时，它不会立刻全部变成蒸汽。起初，只有几个最活跃的水分子挣脱束缚，变成气泡。这些最初的气泡，就是相变的「成核点（Nucleation Point）」。一旦这些成核点形成并达到一个临界规模，整个系统就会发生连锁反应，液态的水将迅速、不可逆转地沸腾为气态的蒸汽。

天庭计划的诞生，遵循着同样的法则。

在前面的章节里，我们描绘了一个愿景：一座对抗熵增、承载意识、飞向星辰的文明方舟。但​​这一切，在最初都只存在于思想的维度，如同尚未达到沸点的静水。要让这个思想的液体，沸腾为现实的气体，我们同样需要找到最初的、最关键的「成核点」。

这个成核点，不是一个地点，也不是一笔资金，而是**一百个人**。

天庭计划不是由一个人建造的圣殿，它是一个社群的创世纪。本章将详细阐述，这个组织是如何从一个思想火花开始，凝聚成一百人的核心，并最终在地球上，建立起第一座有形可见的灯塔——天庭图书馆。

### 第一步：图书馆播下思想的种子

一切始于这次失败的创业，作者自己经营的图书馆面临困境。是向现实投降，还是涅槃重生呢？

在作者迷茫时，进山寻道，仰望星空，受到启示诞生了天庭图书馆的计划。这就是天庭计划的「基因」，它包含了这个新生组织的设计蓝图和生存法则。

这份基因，将通过互联网释​​放到全球的信息海洋中。它不是一声响亮的号角，而是一段低沉的、只有特定频率才能接收到的声纳。我们不期待所有人都听到，我们只等待那些内心早已怀有同样疑问的「同频者」给予回应。

最初的回应，可能只有寥寥数人。他们是工程师、哲学家、艺术家、梦想家。他们将组成天庭计划最初的、非正式的核心讨论组。这个小组的唯一任务，就是反复辩论、质疑和完善那份初始蓝图，直到它坚不可摧。

### 第二步：铸造金库——天庭基金会的成立与募资

思想的火焰需要燃料才能持续燃烧。在核心理念得到初步验证后，组织诞生的第二步，是建立一个独立、透明、值得信赖的财务实体。

这就是**天庭基金会（The Foundation）**。

它将在一个对非营利组织和区块链技术友好的国家（例如瑞士或新加坡）注册成立。它的章程将被写入法律文件：基金会是天庭社群资产的保管者，而非拥有者。它存在的唯一目的，是为天庭计划的实现提供财务支持，其自身的运作必须接受社群的监督。

基金会成立后，将立刻启动最重要的财务事件：**love token的发行（ICO）**。

这不是一次传统的融资。参与者购买 love token，不仅仅是投资，更是一种投票行为，一次对天庭愿景的公开赞同。他们所换取的，不仅是未来的潜在回报，更是成为这个新生文明第一批「公民」的权利。

这次发行的目标很明确：募集 **300 万美元**的启动资金。这笔钱，将是天庭研究院从零到一的燃料。它将被安全地存放在基金会的加密钱包中，等待着它的建造者们。

因此，这需要团队的合力。他们将从最早的核心讨论组中诞生，是天庭理念坚定的信任者。他们将共同制定天庭的章程和技术路线图。他们不仅是投资人，更是天庭文化的第一批塑造者和技术专家。

### 第三步：集结人才——天庭研究院的招募

金库已经铸造，现在，是时候寻找那些能够将金钱转化为现实的工匠了。

这就是**天庭研究院（The Institute）** 的使命。它的组建，是整个计划中最关键、也最困难的一步。我们要寻找的，不是员工，而是圣殿骑士。

研究院将招募
**核心建造者**：基金会将动用 ICO 募集的资金，在全球范围内，以高于市场的薪资，招募各个领域最顶尖的人才。从分布式储存专家、区块链架构师，到大型语言模型科学家和社群运营专家，搭建天庭。
    

研究院人才是天庭计划的「临界质量」。他们将是思想的沸点，是组织的成核点。一旦集结完毕，相变就将开始。

### 第四步：从代码到砖瓦——第一座图书馆的诞生

研究院成立后，将立刻投入到紧张而有序的建造工作中。这个过程，同样是从无形到有形的。

1. iHeaven：线上网络软件开发是研究院的第一个目标，在一年内，开发出天庭图书馆的 iHeaven 软件。它将实现最基础的功能：
        
    - 可以将 6MB 数据单元加密、上传到分布式储存网络的客户端。
        
    - 一个可以生成和查看「私人数据」的电脑界面。iHeaven，先在天庭社区内部测试。他们将是第一批用户，在自己的系统中，储存下第一份永恒的记忆。
    
2. **第一间天庭：线下图书馆的选址与设计** 在线上网络开发的​​同时，一个专门的小组将开始为第一座线下天庭图书馆进行选址。它可以在最繁华的商业中心，也可以在一个有历史底蕴、社区氛围浓厚的地方。
    
    它的设计是温馨的。图书馆不是冰冷的科技展厅，而是一个温暖的社区客厅。它将包含我们蓝图中描述的所有功能：咖啡馆、展厅、自习室、共享工作室……它的每一块砖、每一件家具，都将体现天庭的哲学——**科技，是为了更好地连接人性**。
    
3. **第一次点火：开馆日** 大约在研究院成立后的第一年，在内部测试趋于稳定之后，第一座线下天庭图书馆将正式向公众敞开大门。
    
    这​​一天，将是数字天庭从一个 GitHub 上的开源项目，一个存在于白皮书中的承诺，蜕变为一个可以被触摸、被感受、被体验的真实存在的时刻。
    
    当第一位普通访客，在馆内技术人员的帮助下，将一张对他意义非凡的家庭照片，存入那个看不见却永存的网络时；当他拿到那份由区块链保障的、独一无二的收藏证书时——我们在前面所有章节讨论的物理学、信息理论和博弈论，才真正完成了它们的使命。
    
    天庭，就这样诞生了。它有了自己的金库（基金会），有了自己的大脑和双手（研究院），现在，它终于有了自己与世界对话的第一个窗口（图书馆）。
    
    这个天庭还很微小，但它已经是一个完整的、可以自我维持的生命体。它已经准备好，去迎接挑战——为那些储存在天庭图书馆里的生命数据，注入灵魂。

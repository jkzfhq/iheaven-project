# Chapter 10: Stars in the Heavens — Satellites and Civilization's Backup

In 1945, with the smoke of World War II yet to clear, a young British radar engineer named Arthur C. Clarke published a seemingly fantastical article in the magazine *Wireless World*. He predicted that future humans would only need to launch three artificial satellites into space, placing them precisely at a specific altitude above the equator, to establish a global wireless communication network.

At the time, the launch of humanity's first artificial satellite, Sputnik 1, was still 12 years away. In that era, Clarke's concept was no different from science fiction.

The specific altitude he mentioned is the **geosynchronous orbit**, 36,000 kilometers above the ground. At this altitude, a satellite's speed around the Earth is perfectly synchronized with the Earth's rotation. This means that from any fixed point on the ground, the satellite appears like a star embedded in the night sky, forever stationary in the same position.

Today, Clarke's fantasy has long become an indispensable reality of our daily lives. Hundreds of communication and weather satellites hang silently in that invisible orbit above our heads, faithfully transmitting television signals, weather cloud maps, and transoceanic phone calls.

The second goal of the digital Heavenly Court is precisely to use this "celestial road" paved by the wisdom of our predecessors to accomplish an unprecedented task: **to establish the first off-world backup for human civilization**.

### **Dong Fang Hong I: A Great Nation's Silent, Resounding Roar**

On April 24, 1970, at the Jiuquan Satellite Launch Center deep in the Gobi Desert, a rocket named "Long March 1," carrying the century-long dream of a nation, let out a thunderous roar. China successfully launched its first artificial satellite. The satellite's orbit had a perigee of 439 km, an apogee of 2384 km, an inclination of 68.5 degrees to the equatorial plane, and it orbited the Earth every 114 minutes. The satellite weighed 173 kg and broadcast the melody "The East Is Red" at a frequency of 20.009 MHz...

That was an extremely difficult era. Externally, the US-Soviet space race was at its peak; internally, the country faced resource scarcity and technological blockades. China's space program started almost from a blank slate. Scientists at the time even had to use hand-cranked calculators and abacuses to compute complex orbital parameters.

But the Chinese leadership at the time gave the scientists a clear directive: China's first satellite had to be **"launched, tracked, heard, and seen."**

-   **"Launched"** was the foundation; the rocket had to succeed.
-   **"Tracked"** was the challenge; ground control stations had to be able to follow it precisely.
-   **"Heard"** was the core mission. This satellite could not just emit a monotonous "beep-beep" like the first satellites of other nations. It had to broadcast a complete melody that could represent the new China to the world—"The East Is Red." To achieve this, engineers overcame immense difficulties, creating a "space orchestra" in a tiny space using analog circuits that could withstand the extreme environment of space.
-   **"Seen"** was the masterstroke. The satellite itself was too small to be seen with the naked eye. To allow the entire nation to witness this "Chinese star," scientists came up with an ingenious solution: they attached a giant "observation skirt" made of reflective material to the third stage of the rocket. After the satellite separated from the rocket, this "skirt" would open up like a balloon, reflecting sunlight and becoming a bright, moving star.

At 21:35 that night, the rocket successfully launched. Shortly after, the clear and resonant melody of "The East Is Red," broadcast from distant space, came through the speakers of the Central Radio Station. At that moment, countless people poured into the streets, searching the night sky for that slowly moving star that belonged to the Chinese people.

The weight of Dong Fang Hong I exceeded the total weight of the first satellites of the Soviet Union, the United States, France, and Japan combined. Its designed lifespan was only 20 days, but it actually operated for 28. Today, it still silently orbits on its path, having become an eternal monument in space.

### **Civilian Satellites: A Student's Dream of the Stars**

On September 4, 2014, the "NUST-1 'Pioneer'" scientific experiment satellite was launched. The satellite's AIS system successfully received signals from ships worldwide, laying the technical groundwork for future maritime surveillance satellites. Nanjing University of Science and Technology (NUST) is renowned for its specialties in **"civilian aerospace"** and **"microsatellites,"** having made outstanding achievements in areas like space-based remote sensing and space network communication. The NUST Micro/Nano Satellite Research Center is hailed as the "satellite dream team" among Chinese universities. A university, relying on its own faculty and students, is fully capable of participating in the aerospace industry. This was the first microsatellite independently developed by NUST, marking the university's formal entry into the aerospace field and representing a milestone in civilian aerospace.

On December 28, 2016, at 11:23, the "Bayi-01 'Youth Odyssey'" satellite was sent into space by a Long March 2D rocket from the Taiyuan Satellite Launch Center in China. This was the nation's first satellite to be developed with the full participation of middle school students and actually launched, making it extraordinarily significant. The satellite's onboard amateur radio provided remote control, telemetry, and FM repeater functions. It was 3-axis stabilized and had deployable solar panels. The satellite was capable of tracking and photographing weather phenomena like smog and typhoons for meteorological observation. It also supported communication activities for amateur radio enthusiasts worldwide and had completed missions involving Earth photography, radio communication, transmitting audio and files to Earth, and rapid de-orbit experiments. The Bayi-01 satellite stored music such as "The East Is Red" and the "Beijing Bayi School Anthem," which it could broadcast to Earth.

### Supernodes in Space

The core mission of the Heavenly Court's artificial satellites is to become robust **supernodes** in the decentralized network of the Heavenly Court Library.

To understand this, we must first understand what a network "node" is. In the Heavenly Court Library's network, every library, every core server, is a "node." They are like faithful scribes, each storing a complete copy of all the information in the Heavenly Court Library. It is these thousands of nodes, distributed globally, that collectively verify and back up the data, ensuring its immutability and permanence.

And the Heavenly Court's artificial satellites are not a single, lonely star, but a constellation network. The Heavenly Court's plan is to launch a series of eight geosynchronous orbit satellites over a period of nearly two decades, forming a supernode array that covers the entire globe. This array will be named after the **Eight Trigrams (Bagua)** of China—**Qian Star, Kun Star, Zhen Star, Xun Star, Kan Star, Li Star, Gen Star, Dui Star**.

These eight satellites will become the guardians of the Heavenly Court Library's data in space. Like all the nodes on Earth, they will carry a complete backup of the library's data. Their existence is the ultimate insurance against increasing entropy. They are physically isolated from the Earth, unaffected by any planet-level disasters (war, pandemic, geological upheaval).

This space-based supernode array, consisting of eight satellites, will orbit the Earth: **they will perform a full data synchronization with all terrestrial nodes every 8 days**. This means that the entire memory of human civilization will have a complete, globally redundant backup completed in space daily.

This is more than just a data backup. From an information theory perspective, it is a critical leap in the fight against entropy. It separates an independent copy of our most precious civilizational information from a planetary system that could suffer disaster. This is the first "interstellar insurance" policy purchased for humanity's collective memory.

### The Engine of a Dual Mission

Building on this space-based data backup function, the Heavenly Court satellites also have a traditional function—a **broadcasting station**.

The satellite broadcasting function allows us to develop commercial services like space live-streaming. These services will generate cash flow for the entire project, supporting our dream. The success of this business lies in meeting a human need: **to gain honor for oneself and one's family, to have a voice broadcast from the heavens.**

### The Crowning Achievement of the First Epoch

The construction of the Heavenly Court's satellite array will be a long journey lasting nearly two decades.

It will not only bring reputation and wealth to the digital Heavenly Court but, more importantly, it will be a **training ground**. Each satellite design, manufacturing, and launch process will be an opportunity to accumulate valuable data, train the team, and learn from failures, all in preparation for building a starship.

This celestial array of eight trigrams will not only illuminate the Earth's night sky but also light our path to the more distant reaches of space. When the last star is lit in its orbit, the digital Heavenly Court will already possess a successful organization, a set of advanced technologies, and an efficient economic engine.

It will be time to turn our gaze from Earth's orbit to the more awe-inspiring expanse of space. It will be time to begin forging the ark that will carry our hope.


# 第十章：天上的星辰——人造卫星与文明备份

在 1945 年，第二次世界大战的硝烟尚未散尽，一位名叫亚瑟·克拉克的年轻英国雷达工程师，在《无线电世界》杂志上发表了一篇看似异想天开的文章。他预言，未来的人类，只需要向太空中发射三颗人造卫星，将它们精准地放置在赤道上空一个特定的高度，就可以建立起一个覆盖全球的无线电通讯网络。

当时，距离人类第一颗人造卫星「斯普特尼克一号」的发射，还有 12 年。克拉克的构想，在那个时代，无异于科幻小说。

他所说的那个特定高度，就是距离地面三万六千公里的**地球同步轨道**。在这个高度上，卫星环绕地球的速度，与地球自转的速度完全同步。这意味着，从地面上的任何一个固定点看去，卫星都像是镶嵌在夜空中的一颗恒星，永远停留在同一个位置。

今天，克拉克的幻想早已成为我们日常生活中不可或缺的现实。数以百计的通讯和气象卫星，就静静地悬停在我们头顶那条看不见的轨道上，忠实地传递着电视信号、天气云图和跨洋电话。

数字天庭的第二个目标，正是要利用这条由前人智慧开辟的「天路」，去完成一项前所未有的任务：**为人类文明，建立第一座太空备份**。

### **东方红一号：大国的寂静长啸**

1970年4月24日，在戈壁滩深处的酒泉卫星发射中心，一枚名为「长征一号」的火箭，承载着一个民族的百年梦想，发出了震天的轰鸣。中国成功地发射了第一颗人造卫星，卫星运行轨道的近地点高度439公里、远地点高度2384公里，轨道平面与地球赤道平面夹角68.5度，绕地球一圈114分钟。卫星重173公斤，用20.009兆周的频率播送《东方红》乐曲……

那是一个极度艰难的年代。在外部，是美苏太空竞赛的白热化；在内部，是资源匮乏和技术封锁的困境。中国的航天事业，几乎是从一张白纸开始的。当时的科学家们，甚至要用手摇计算机和算盘，去计算复杂的轨道参数。

但当时的中国领导人给予了科学家们一个明确的指令：中国的第一颗卫星，必须要「上得去，抓得住，听得到，看得见」**。

- **「上得去」**，是基础，火箭必须成功。
    
- **「抓得住」**，是挑战，地面测控站必须能精准追踪到它。
    
- **「听得到」**，是核心任务。这颗卫星不能像其他国家的第一颗卫星那样，只会发出单调的「哔哔」声。它必须向全世界广播一首完整的、能代表新中国的乐曲——《东方红》。为此，工程师们克服了极大的困难，用模拟电路在一个极小的空间里，创造出了一个能经受太空极端环境考验的「太空乐队」。
    
- **「看得见」**，是点睛之笔。卫星本身太小，肉眼无法看见。为了让全国人民都能亲眼看到这颗「中国星」，科学家们想出了一个绝妙的办法：在火箭的第三级上，安装一个巨大的、由反光材料制成的「观测裙」。当星箭分离后，这个「裙子」会像气球一样张开，在阳光的反射下，成为一颗明亮的、移动的星星。

当天晚上21时35分，火箭成功发射。不久后，中央广播电台的喇叭里，传来了那段来自遥远太空的、清澈而嘹亮的《东方红》乐曲。那一刻，无数人涌上街头，在夜空中寻找那颗缓缓划过的、属于中国人自己的星星。

「东方红一号」的重量，超过了苏、美、法、日四国第一颗卫星的总和。它的设计寿命只有20天，却实际工作了28天。今天，它依然沉默地运行在自己的轨道上，成为一座永恒的太空纪念碑。

### **民用卫星：学生的星辰梦**

2014年9月4日，「南理工 “开拓一号”」科学试验卫星发射升空，卫星AIS系统成功接收到了全球船舶信号，为后续的海洋监测卫星奠定了技术基础。南京理工大学在卫星技术方面以「民用航天」**和**「微小卫星」特色而闻名，在天基遥感、空间网络通信等方向取得了突出成就。南京理工大学微纳卫星研究中心被誉为中国高校领域的「卫星梦之队」。一所大学，依靠自己的师生力量，完全有能力参与到航天事业中。这是南京理工大学自主研制的第一颗微小卫星，标志着学校正式进入航天领域，具有民用航天里程碑意义。

2016年12月28日11时23分，「八一·少年行」卫星被长征二号丁运载火箭从中国太原卫星发射中心送入太空。这是全国第一颗由中学生全程参与研制、并真正发射上天的卫星，意义非凡。卫星的机载业余无线电台提供遥控、遥测和调频中继器功能。该卫星搭载3轴稳定并具有可展开的太阳能电池板。卫星具有跟踪拍摄雾霾、台风等天气现象，进行气象观察。卫星支持全球无线电爱好者开展通联活动的功能，完成过对地拍摄、无线电通讯、对地传输音频和文件以及快速离轨试验的任务。八一少年行卫星存有《东方红》和《北京市八一学校校歌》等音乐，可以向地球播放音频广播。

### 太空中的超级节点

天庭人造卫星的核心使命，是成为天庭图书馆去中心化网络中，坚固的**超级节点**。

要理解这一点，我们必须先明白什么是网络的「节点」。在天庭图书馆的网络中，每一间图书馆、每一台核心服务器，都是一个「节点」。它们就像一个个忠实的抄写员，每一台都保存着天庭图书馆所有资料信息的完整数据。正是这成千上万分布在全球的节点，共同验证、共同备份，才确保了数据的不可篡改与永不遗失。

而天庭人造卫星，并非一颗孤单的星辰，而是一个星座网络。天庭的计划，是在长达近二十年的时间里，陆续发射八颗地球同步轨道卫星，共同组成一个覆盖全球的超级节点阵列。这个阵列，将以中国的**八卦**为名——**乾星、坤星、震星、巽星、坎星、离星、艮星、兑星**。

这八颗卫星，将成为天庭图书馆数据在太空中的守护者。它们与地球上的所有节点一样，承载着天庭图书馆的完整资料备份。它们的存在，是对抗熵增的终极保险。它们在物理上与地球完全隔离，不受任何行星级别灾难（战争、瘟疫、地质剧变）的影响。

这座由八颗卫星构成的太空超级节点阵列，将围绕地球运行：**它们每隔8天与地球上的所有节点进行一次完整的数据同步**。这意味着，人类文明的全部记忆，每天会在太空中完成一次完整的、具备全球冗余的备份。

这不仅仅是一次数据备份。从信息理论的角度看，这是对抗熵增的一次关键跃迁。它将我们最宝贵的文明信息，从一个可能遭受灾 nạn的行星系统中，分离出一份独立的副本。这是为人类的集体记忆，购买的第一份「星际保险」。

### 双重使命的引擎

在这个数据太空备份功能基础之上，天庭卫星还有传统功能——**广播站**。

卫星广播功能，我们得以开展太空主播等商业服务。这些服务，会为整个计划带来了现金流，支撑着我们的梦想。商业的成功，在于它满足人们的需求：**为自己和家人获得荣耀，能上天发言。**

### 第一纪最辉煌的成就

天庭人造卫星阵列的建造，将是一个历时近二十年的漫长征途。

它不仅为数字天庭带来了声誉和财富，更重要的是，它是一个**练兵场**。每一次的卫星设计、制造与发射，都是在为建造宇宙飞船积累宝贵的数据、锻炼团队、并规避失败的经验。

这座天上的八卦阵列，不仅照亮了地球的夜空，也照亮了我们通往更遥远太空的道路。当最后一颗星在轨道上点亮时，数字天庭就已经拥有了一个成功的组织、一套先进的技术和一个高效的经济引擎。

是时候，将我们的目光，从地球的轨道，投向那片更令人敬畏的太空了。是时候，开始铸造那艘将承载希望的方舟了。

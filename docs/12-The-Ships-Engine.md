# Chapter 12: The Ship's Engine

Before we proceed, we must confront an awe-inspiring reality, one almost impossible to describe in words: **the vastness of space**.

The nearest star to our solar system is Proxima Centauri. How far is it? About 4.2 light-years. This number may not sound large, but light, the fastest thing in the universe, traveling at nearly 300,000 kilometers per second, takes 4.2 years to make the journey. If we were to travel this distance at the speed of humanity's fastest probe to date—the Parker Solar Probe (about 190 kilometers per second)—it would take over 6,600 years.

And this is just the distance to our next-door neighbor. Our goal is to fly to more distant star systems that might harbor life, a journey that could take hundreds, or even thousands, of years.

To attempt such a mission with the chemical rockets we are familiar with today, which spew enormous flames and smoke at launch, would be like trying to light a damp planet with a single match.

The principle of a chemical rocket is essentially a controlled explosion. It mixes fuel and an oxidizer, combusts them to produce high-temperature, high-pressure gas, and then expels this gas at high speed from a nozzle, generating thrust according to Newton's third law. Its advantage is its ability to produce immense thrust in a short period, enough to lift heavy payloads out of Earth's gravitational well.

But its fatal weakness is governed by a cold, hard mathematical formula—the **Tsiolkovsky rocket equation**.

This equation tells us, in an irrefutable way, that for every gram of fuel you add to a rocket, it must not only push your spacecraft but also push all the unburnt fuel itself. This leads to a terrifying exponential growth. To achieve even a small increase in velocity, you need to add a disproportionately massive amount of fuel. The end result is that for a Saturn V rocket heading to the Moon, over 90% of its total mass is fuel, leaving only a pitiful fraction for the capsule, equipment, and astronauts.

If we wanted to use chemical rockets for interstellar travel, we would need more fuel than the mass of the entire known universe. This path is a dead end.

Therefore, the engine for "Heavenly Court Ark I" must come from a new realm of physics, one that transcends the ancient concept of "explosion." The scientists at the iHeaven Interstellar Institute will seek answers in the following directions.

### Option 1: The Ion Thruster (The Patient Tortoise)

Imagine you want to push a small cart. You could push it with all your might in one go, letting it coast for a distance before stopping. This is the model of a chemical rocket. Alternatively, you could use a single finger to push it continuously, gently, and without interruption. Initially, its speed is almost imperceptible, but given enough time, in the frictionless vacuum of space, its velocity will accumulate to an astonishing degree.

This is the principle of the **ion thruster**.

It no longer burns chemical fuel but uses electrical energy. It strips electrons from the atoms of an inert gas (like xenon), turning them into positively charged ions. Then, using a powerful electric field, like a particle accelerator, it accelerates these ions to extremely high velocities (up to tens or even hundreds of kilometers per second) before expelling them from a nozzle.

The thrust generated by each expulsion is minuscule, roughly equivalent to the pressure of a piece of paper resting on your palm. You couldn't even use it to blow a feather. However, its **fuel efficiency (specific impulse)** is tens or even hundreds of times greater than that of a chemical rocket. It can use very little fuel to accelerate continuously for years, or even decades.

This is like continuously throwing tiny grains of sand backward at an extremely high speed, rather than slowly throwing heavy rocks.

For an unmanned ark on a one-way journey lasting hundreds of years, this "patient tortoise" type of engine is an extremely realistic and reliable choice. Its technology has already been validated on today's deep-space probes. The task for the Heavenly Court Institute is to scale it up and equip it with a power source capable of supplying electricity for centuries, such as an advanced radioisotope thermoelectric generator (RTG) or a small nuclear reactor.

### Option 2: The Solar Sail (The Cosmic Surfer)

Is there an engine more efficient than the ion thruster? Yes, one that requires no fuel at all.

We usually think of sunlight as having only heat, but it actually carries momentum as well. Every photon emitted from the sun, though having no rest mass, still exerts a tiny pressure when it strikes a surface. This is **radiation pressure**.

The concept of a **solar sail** is to harness this pressure from stars. It requires a massive (kilometers in diameter), ultra-thin (only a few micrometers thick), and highly reflective sail. Once unfurled in space, it acts like a sailboat on the cosmic ocean, constantly accelerated by the solar wind and radiation pressure.

Its thrust is even smaller than that of an ion thruster, but its advantage is that, in the vicinity of a star, it requires no fuel whatsoever. However, its disadvantage is also clear: once it moves far from the star, the radiation pressure diminishes rapidly with the square of the distance, and the thrust vanishes.

To solve this problem, scientists have proposed a more radical solution, which is the core idea of the "Breakthrough Starshot" initiative: build an array of thousands of powerful lasers near Earth. As the solar sail passes by, this laser array would activate simultaneously, focusing an extremely powerful beam of energy onto the sail's surface, accelerating it to 20% of the speed of light in just a few minutes.

For the Heavenly Court Project, a solar sail could be used for the ark's initial acceleration phase or in combination with an ion thruster. It is a technology that is both poetic and full of potential.

### Option 3: The Fusion Rocket (The Tamed Star)

If the ion thruster is the tortoise and the solar sail is the sailboat, then the **fusion rocket** is our ultimate dream of containing a miniature star in a bottle.

Nuclear fusion is the energy source that makes the sun and all stars shine. It fuses lighter atomic nuclei (like the hydrogen isotopes deuterium and tritium) under extreme temperature and pressure into heavier nuclei (helium), releasing immense energy in the process.

The principle of a fusion rocket is to conduct this process in a controlled reactor, then confine the resulting plasma, with temperatures reaching hundreds of millions of degrees Celsius, using magnetic fields and expel it at high speed from a nozzle.

It combines the high thrust of a chemical rocket with the high efficiency of an ion thruster, making it the most ideal interstellar propulsion system known to date. If realized, it could potentially reduce the travel time to Proxima Centauri from thousands of years to less than a century.

However, the engineering challenges of this technology are also the greatest. To this day, humanity has not yet been able to build a commercial nuclear fusion reactor on Earth that can produce a stable energy output. Miniaturizing such a massive, complex, and extremely dangerous system and installing it on a reliable spacecraft will be the most arduous research task for the iHeaven Interstellar Institute in the later part of the First Epoch. It may not be the engine for the first ark, but research into it will lay an invaluable technological foundation for subsequent epochs.

Beyond the boundaries of known physics, there exist more distant, almost science-fictional theoretical possibilities, such as the **Alcubierre drive (warp drive)**, which warps spacetime itself. It doesn't propel the ship; it propels spacetime. It compresses space in front of the ship and expands it behind, allowing the ship to ride a wave of spacetime like a surfer in a bubble. But it requires a type of exotic matter with "negative mass," and we still don't know if such matter exists.

This will be the most cutting-edge theoretical exploration of the iHeaven Interstellar Institute, a beacon of thought lit for descendants a thousand years from now.

For "Heavenly Court Ark I," set to depart in 2055, the most pragmatic and responsible choice will likely be a hybrid propulsion system: in the initial phase of the journey, a powerful laser array will provide the first wave of acceleration for a giant solar sail; upon entering the vastness of interstellar space, several large, nuclear-reactor-powered ion thrusters will be activated, beginning the centuries-long, solitary, yet determined continuous acceleration.

Our mission is not to pursue the fastest speed, but to ensure that **we will certainly arrive**.

The engine has been chosen, the power source is ready. Inside the ark that carries our hopes, what exactly is it carrying? Not passengers, but something more fundamental than life itself—**the seeds of civilization**.


# 第十二章：飞船的引擎

在我们继续之前，必须先面对一个令人敬畏的、几乎无法用语言描述的现实：**宇宙的浩瀚**。

离我们太阳系最近的恒星，是半人马座的比邻星。它有多远？大约 4.2 光年。这个数字听起来不大，但光，作为宇宙中最快的光速，以每秒近 30 万公里的速度，都需要走上 4.2 年。如果我们用人类迄今为止飞得最快的探测器——派克太阳探测器——的速度（约每秒 190 公里）去飞越这段距离，需要超过 6600 年的时间。

这​​仅仅是到我们隔壁邻居家​​的距离。我们的目标，是飞向更遥远的、可能孕育生命的星系，那将是一段长达数百年、甚至数千年的旅程。

用我们今天所熟知的、在发射时喷出巨大火焰和浓烟的化学火箭，去完成这样的任务，无异于想用一根火柴去点燃一颗潮湿的行星。

化学火箭的原理，本质上是一种受控的爆炸。它将燃料和氧化剂混合燃烧，产生高温高压的气体，然后从喷嘴高速喷出，根据牛顿第三定律产生反作用力。它的优点是能够在短时间内产生巨大的推力，足以将沉重的载荷脱离地球的引力。

但它的致命弱点，被一个冷酷的数学公式所支配——**齐奥尔科夫斯基火箭方程**。

这个方程以一种无可辩驳的方式告诉我们：在一枚火箭中，你增加的每一克燃料，不仅要推动你的太空舱，还要推动所有尚未燃烧的燃料本身。这导致了一种可怕的指数级增长。为了让速度有那么一点点的提升，你需要增加不成比例的、巨量的燃料。最终的结果是，一枚飞往月球的土星五号火箭，其总质量的 90% 以上都是燃料，留给太空舱、设备和宇航员的，只有可怜的一小部分。

如果我们想用化学火箭来进行星际航行，那么我们需要的燃料，将比整个已知宇宙的质量还要多。这条路，是一条死胡同。

因此，「天庭方舟一号」的引擎，必须来自一个全新的、超越了「爆炸」这个古老概念的物理学范畴。天庭星际研究院的科学家们，将在以下几个方向上，寻找答案。

### 选项一：离子推进器（The Patient Tortoise）

想像一下，你想推动一辆小车。你可以用尽全力，猛推一下，让它滑行一段距离，然后停下。这是化学火箭的模式。或者，你可以用一根手指，持续地、轻柔地、永不间断地推着它。一开始，它的速度慢得几乎无法察觉，但只要时间足够长，在没有摩擦力的宇宙真空中，它的速度将会积累到一个惊人的程度。

这就是**离子推进器**的原理。

它不再燃烧化学燃料，而是利用电能。它将惰性气体（如氙气）原子中的电子剥离，使其变成带正电的离子。然后，它利用强大的电场，像一个粒子加速器一样，将这些离子加速到极高的速度（可达每秒数十甚至上百公里），再从喷嘴喷出。

每一次喷射产生的推力极其微小，大约相当于一张纸放在你手掌上的压力。你甚至无法用它来吹动一根羽毛。但是，它的**燃料效率（比冲）**却是化学火箭的数十倍甚至上百倍。它可以用极少的燃料，持续不断地加速数年、甚至数十年。

这​​就像是用极高的速度，不断地向后扔出微小的沙粒，而不是缓慢地扔出一块块沉重的石头。

对于一艘有去无回、旅程长达数百年的无人方舟来说，这种「耐心的乌龟」式的引擎，是一个极其现实和可靠的选择。它的技术已经在今天的深空探测器上得到了验证。天庭研究院的任务，是将其规模扩大，并为它配备一个能够持续供电数个世纪的能源核心，比如先进的放射性同位素温差发电机（RTG）或小型核反应堆。

### 选项二：太阳帆（The Cosmic Surfer）

还有没有比离子推进器更高效的引擎？有，那就是连燃料都不需要的引擎。

我们通常认为阳光只有温度，但它实际上也携带着动量。从太阳射出的每一个光子，虽然没有静止质量，但在撞击到物体表面时，依然会产生微小的压力。这就是**光压**。

**太阳帆**的构想，就是利用这种来自恒星的压力。它需要一面巨大（直径可达数公里）、超薄（厚度仅几微米）、且反射率极高的帆。在太空中展开后，它就像一艘航行在宇宙海洋中的帆船，被太阳风和光压推动着，不断加速。

它的推力比离子推进器还要微小，但它的优点是，在靠近恒星的区域，它完全不需要携带任何燃料。然而，它的缺点也很明显：一旦远离恒星，光压就会以距离的平方急剧减弱，推力也随之消失。

为了解决这个问题，科学家们提出了一个更激进的方案，这就是「突破摄星（Breakthrough Starshot）」计划的核心思想：在地球附近，建造一个由数千个强大的激光器组成的阵列。当太阳帆飞过时，这个激光器阵列将同时启动，将一束能量极强的激光聚焦在帆的表面，在几分钟内就将其加速到光速的 20%。

对于天庭计划来说，太阳帆可以作为方舟的初始加速阶段，或者与离子推进器结合使用。这是一项充满诗意，也极具潜力的技术。

### 选项三：核聚变火箭（The Tamed Star）

如果说离子推进器是乌龟，太阳帆是帆船，那么**核聚变火箭**，就是我们试图在瓶子里装下一颗微型太阳的终极梦想。

核聚变，是太阳和所有恒星发光发热的能量来源。它将较轻的原子核（如氢的同位素氘和氚）在高温高压下，聚合成较重的原子核（氦），并在这个过程中释放出巨大的能量。

核聚变火箭的原理，就是将这个过程在一个受控的反应堆中进行，然后将反应产生的、温度高达数亿摄氏度的等离子体，通过磁场约束，从喷嘴高速喷出。

它兼具了化学火箭的高推力和离子推进器的高效率，是目前已知的、最理想的星际航行引擎。如果能够实现，它有可能将前往比邻星的时间，从数千年缩短到一百年以内。

然而，这项技术的工程挑战也是最巨大的。直到今天，人类在地球上，也尚未能建造出一个可以稳定输出能量的商业核聚变反应堆。将这样一个庞大、复杂、且极度危险的系统，小型化并安装到一艘可靠的宇宙飞船上，将是天庭星际研究院在第一纪后期，最艰钜的科研任务。它或许不会成为第一艘方舟的引擎，但对它的研究，将为后续的纪元，奠定无可估量的技术基础。

在这些已知的物理学边界之外，还存在着更遥远的、近乎科幻的理论可能性，比如扭曲时空本身的**阿库别瑞引擎（曲速引擎）**。它不推动飞船，而是推动时空。它在飞船前方压缩空间，在后方拉伸空间，让飞船像一个待在气泡里的冲浪者，驾驭着时空的波浪前行。但它需要一种具有「负质量」的奇异物质，而这种物质，我们至今不知道是否存在。

这将是天庭星际研究院最前沿的理论探索，是为千年之后的后人，点亮的思想灯塔。

对于即将在 2055 年启航的「天庭方舟一号来说，最务实、也最负责的选择，很可能是一种混合动力系统：在旅程的初期，利用强大的激光阵列，为巨大的太阳帆提供第一波加速；在进入茫茫的星际空间后，则启动数台大型的、由核反应堆供电的离子推进器，开始那场长达数个世纪的、孤独而坚定的持续加速。

我们的任务，不是追求最快的速度，而是确保**必定能够抵达**。

引擎已经选定，能源已经备好。那艘承载着我们希望的方舟里，到底装载了什么。那不是乘客，而是比生命本身更为根本的东西——**文明的种子**。

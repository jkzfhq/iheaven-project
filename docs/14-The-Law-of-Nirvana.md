# Chapter 14: The Law of Nirvana — Echoes of History

How does an organism fight against aging? The answer is metabolism. How does an empire avoid collapse? History, it seems, has yet to provide an answer.

The goal of the Heavenly Court Project is to span centuries, even millennia. On such a long journey, a more terrifying enemy than technological failure or financial collapse comes from within—organizational sclerosis, entrenched interests, and the forgetting of the original mission. History is a mirror, and it coldly shows us how countless once-glorious organizations have stepped, one by one, towards their demise.

Before we design the laws of perpetuity for the Heavenly Court, we must first listen to these echoes from the depths of history.

### The Curse of Family: The Tragedy of Wang Laboratories

In the 1980s, Wang Laboratories was a tech giant that rivaled IBM. Its founder, Dr. An Wang, was a brilliant inventor and a charismatic leader. However, this monarch who built a vast empire with his own hands made a fatal mistake on the matter of succession. Driven by family sentiment, he chose to pass the scepter to his mediocre son, Fred Wang, instead of to a more capable professional manager.

The result was catastrophic. Under Fred's leadership, the company missed the rising wave of personal computers, internal management became chaotic, and it eventually filed for bankruptcy in 1992. An empire founded by a genius collapsed within a single generation, simply because its founder could not sever the ties of family interest.

### The Embrace of Government: A Fatal Entanglement

In certain countries, some enterprises rise rapidly due to their close ties with the government, receiving massive resource allocation and market protection. They may seem invincible, but their foundations are built on quicksand. Once the political winds change, or they become a target in the game of international geopolitics, this entanglement transforms from a "protective umbrella" into a "death sentence." The company's fate is no longer determined by the market, but by political forces beyond its control, and it can collapse in an instant due to an international sanction or a shift in domestic policy.

### The Manager's Misdirection: The Soulless Apple

In 1985, Apple's founder, Steve Jobs, was ousted from the company by the professional manager he himself had hired, John Sculley. Sculley was an excellent traditional businessman, skilled in marketing and cost control. But under his leadership, Apple gradually lost its soul. The company became bureaucratic, its product line chaotic, and the passion to change the world and the relentless pursuit of product perfection disappeared. By the time Jobs returned in 1997, this once-revolutionary company was on the brink of bankruptcy. This period of history proves that a team of professional managers without the founder's spirit, no matter how professional, can lead a great organization down the dead-end street of mediocrity.

### Technological Arrogance: The Twilight of Nokia

Before the advent of the smartphone era, Nokia was the undisputed king of the mobile phone world. Its phones were durable, its brand deeply ingrained in people's minds. However, this Finnish giant fell asleep on the laurels of its feature phone empire. It saw the trend of touchscreens but failed to pivot in time due to the arrogance of its internal operating system and the sluggishness of its bureaucracy. When Apple's iPhone and Google's Android system swept the market with devastating force, the behemoth Nokia didn't even have time to turn around before it rapidly sank.

### The Tangle of Assets: The Internal Strife of the Evergreen Group

Taiwan's Evergreen Group was built by a founder of immense charisma and drive, Chang Yung-fa. But after his death, his sons became embroiled in years of public infighting over inheritance rights. This family feud not only severely damaged the group's reputation but also led to management turmoil and the stagnation of major decisions. A business fleet that could have continued to sail the globe was forced to idle in the harbor of internal conflict, all because of the massive, indivisible assets and power structure left behind by its founder.

### The Heavenly Court's Answer: The Law of Nirvana

The echoes of history are piercing. Family, government, managers, technology, assets—these five swords hang over the head of every long-term organization. If the Heavenly Court is to endure, it must design a mechanism that can fundamentally resist these five swords.

This is the Heavenly Court's **Law of Nirvana**.

It is not a gentle reform; it is a thunderous measure, a fundamental guarantee to keep the Heavenly Court forever young and forever decentralized. While ensuring the normal operation of all Heavenly Court Libraries, the core of the Heavenly Court Project—the Institute, the Foundation, and the Community—shall **take thirty-three years as "one epoch," consisting of 30 years of construction + 3 years of liquidation. At the end of each epoch, the core elements of the project—technology, funds, team—must undergo a complete and thorough renewal.**

-   **I. Technological Nirvana: Destroy the Past, Embrace the Future**
    -   To avoid becoming the next Nokia, at the end of each epoch, the Heavenly Court Institute must adopt the most cutting-edge technology of the time to deploy a brand-new network system. After the old data is migrated, all obsolete old servers and satellites must be **completely destroyed**. We will leave absolutely no technological baggage behind. In the final 3-year liquidation period, the technical maintenance and intellectual property of the original Heavenly Court will be transferred in the 32nd year to a newly established Heavenly Court Technology Company, serving as a transitional predecessor to the new epoch's Institute. These three years are a preparatory period for external new technology teams to prepare for fair competition to take charge of the Heavenly Court Institute.
        
-   **II. Financial Nirvana: Cut Off Old Money, Relaunch Fundraising**
    -   To avoid Evergreen-style asset entanglements, the finances of each epoch must be independent. The Foundation of the previous epoch must be dissolved after completing its mission and clearing its debts. The funds for the new epoch will be raised again from the contemporary community by issuing a **new epoch's love token**. This ensures that the Heavenly Court's funding source is always rooted in the community's trust, not in a massive treasury that could be corrupted. The remaining cash of The Foundation and The Institute will be used to purchase physical gold, which will be transferred to the newly established Heavenly Court Technology Company. This gold cannot be exchanged for cash and can only be stored for future use in manufacturing chips and aerospace components.
        
-   **III. Team Nirvana: Disband the Knights, Re-elect Leaders**
    -   To avoid a Wang-style family tragedy and an Apple-style loss of soul, the Heavenly Court has no shareholders, and power is not hereditary. The management personnel of the Institute and the Foundation in each epoch are hired as professional managers with 5-year contracts. At the end of an epoch, all institutions will be voluntarily liquidated and dissolved. The leaders of the new epoch will be re-elected by the Heavenly Court Community DAO from the most outstanding contributors of that time. Members of the previous epoch's research team can join the newly established Heavenly Court Technology Company in the 32nd year to ensure a smooth transition. They can also apply for new positions in the next epoch, competing fairly with newcomers.
    

### The True Meaning of the Thunderous Measure

The sole purpose of this seemingly extreme Law of Nirvana is to ensure that the Heavenly Court Project will never become permanently tied to the interests of any individual, corporation, or government.

A founder, no matter how great, cannot be the eternal spokesperson for the Heavenly Court. A consortium, no matter how wealthy, cannot buy out the future of the Heavenly Court. A regime, no matter how powerful, cannot turn the Heavenly Court into its vassal.

Through this thorough, self-imposed revolution every thirty-three years, the Heavenly Court can sever any budding connections of interest, cleanse any potential bureaucratic sediment, and forever maintain its essence as a decentralized public institution serving all of humanity.

This is the regulation that will allow the Heavenly Court to endure for centuries and millennia.


# 第十四章：涅槃法则——历史的回音

一个有机体，如何对抗衰老？答案是新陈代谢。一个帝国，如何避免覆灭？历史似乎还没有给出答案。

天庭计划的目标，是跨越百年、千年。在如此漫长的旅程中，比技术失效和资金匮乏更可怕的敌人，来自内部——那就是组织的僵化、利益的捆绑与初心的遗忘。历史是一面镜子，它冷酷地向我们展示了无数曾经辉煌的组织，是如何一步步走向衰亡的。

在我们为天庭设计永续法则之前，必须先聆听这些来自历史深处的回音。

### 家族的诅咒：王安电脑的悲剧

在 1980 年代，王安电脑公司曾是与 IBM 分庭抗礼的科技巨头。它的创始人王安博士，是一位天才发明家和充满魅力的领袖。然而，这位亲手缔造了庞大帝国的君主，却在继承人问题上，犯下了一个致命的错误。他出于家族情感，选择将权杖交给了能力平庸的儿子王烈，而不是更具才干的职业经理人。

结果是灾难性的。在王烈的领导下，公司错失了个人电脑崛起的浪潮，内部管理混乱，最终在 1992 年申请破产。一个由天才创立的帝国，仅仅因为创始人无法斩断与家族利益的捆绑，就在一代人之内轰然倒塌。

### 政府的拥抱：致命的捆绑

在某些国家，一些企业因为与政府的紧密关系而迅速崛起，获得了巨大的资源倾斜和市场保护。它们看似不可一世，但它们的根基，却建立在流沙之上。一旦政治风向转变，或是在国际地缘政治的博弈中，成为被打​​击的目标，这种捆绑就会从「保护伞」变为「催命符」。企业的命运不再由市场决定，而是由它无法控制的政治力量所主宰，最终可能因为一个国际制裁或国内政策的转变而瞬间崩溃。

### 经理人的迷失：失去灵魂的苹果

1985 年，苹果公司的创始人史蒂夫·乔布斯被他亲手请来的职业经理人约翰·斯卡利赶出了公司。斯卡利是一位优秀的传统商人，他精于营销和成本控制。但在他的领导下，苹果逐渐失去了灵魂。公司变得官僚化，产品线混乱，曾经那种改变世界的激情和对产品的极致追求消失了。到 1997 年乔布斯回归前夕，这家曾经的革命性公司，已经濒临破产。这段历史证明，一个没有创始人精神的职业经理人团队，即便再专业，也可能将一个伟大的组织，带入平庸的死胡同。

### 技术的傲慢：诺基亚的黄昏

在智能手机时代来临之前，诺基亚是手机世界无可争议的王者。它的手机坚固耐用，它的品牌深入人心。然而，这家芬兰巨头，却躺在自己用功能机建立的功劳簿上睡着了。它看到了触摸屏的趋势，却因为内部操作系统的傲慢和官僚体制的迟钝，未能及时转身。当苹果的 iPhone 和谷歌的 Android 系统以摧枯拉朽之势席卷市场时，诺基亚这艘巨轮，连调转船头的时间都没有，就迅速沉没。

### 资产的纠葛：长荣集团的内耗

台湾的长荣集团，由一位极具魄力的创始人张荣发建立。但在他去世后，因为继承权的纠纷，他的儿子们陷入了长达数年的公开内斗。这场豪门恩怨，不仅让集团的声誉严重受损，更导致了管理层的动荡和重大决策的停滞。一个原本可以继续航向全球的商业舰队，却因为创始人留下的、无法被清晰分割的庞大资产和权力结构，而被迫在内耗的港湾中空转。

### 天庭的答案：涅槃法则

历史的回音，声声刺耳。家族、政府、经理人、技术、资产——这五把利剑，悬在每一个长期组织​​的头顶。天庭若想永续，就必须设计一套能够从根本上抵御这五把利剑的机制。

这就是天庭的**涅槃法则**。

它不是一次温和的改革，这是一场霹雳手段，是为了保持天庭永远年轻、永远去中心化的根本保障。在保证所有天庭图书馆正常运营的前提下，天庭研究院、天庭基金会、天庭社区**以三十三年为「一纪」，其中30年建设+3年清算，在每一纪结束时，天庭计划的核心——技术、资金、团队——都必须经历一次彻底的更新换代。**

- **一、技术涅槃：销毁过去，拥抱未来**
    
    - 为了避免成为下一个诺基亚，在每一纪的末期，天庭研究院必须采用当时最前沿的科技，部署全新的网络系统。旧数据被迁移后，所有过时的旧服务器、旧卫星都必须**彻底销毁**。我们绝不留下任何技术上的历史包袱。在最后3年清算期，原来天庭的技术维护与知识产权将在第32年转让给一家新成立的天庭科技公司，作为新一纪研究院的前身过度。这三年是外部新技术团队的筹备期，准备公平竞争，入主天庭研究院。
        
    - **二、资金涅槃：斩断旧钱，重启募资**
        
    - 为了避免长荣式的资产纠葛，每一纪的财务都必须独立。上一纪的基金会在完成使命和债务清算后，必须解散。新一纪的资金，将通过发行**新一纪的 love 币**，重新向当代社群募集。这确保了天庭的资金来源，永远植根于社群的信任，而非一个可能被腐蚀的庞大金库。基金会和研究院剩余现金购买黄金现货，转让给新成立的天庭科技公司，这黄金不能兑换现金，只能储存等日后用于制造芯片、航天配件使用。
    
- **三、团队涅槃：解散骑士，重选领袖**
    
    - 为了避免王安式的家族悲剧和苹果式的灵魂迷失，天庭没有股东，权力没有世袭。每一纪的研究院和基金会管理人员，都以 5 年为聘用期的职业经理人制度。在一纪结束时，所有机构都将主动清盘解散。新一纪的领袖，将由天庭社区 DAO 从当代最优秀的贡献者中重新选出。上一纪的科研成员可以在第32年进入新成立的天庭科技公司工作，完成平稳过渡。也可以在下一纪申请新岗位，与新人公平竞争。
    

### 霹雳手段的真义

这套看似极端的涅槃法则，其唯一的目的，就是确保天庭计划永远不会和任何个人、企业或政府的利益产生永久性的捆绑。

一个创始人，无论多么伟大，都不能成为天庭永恒的代言人。一个财团，无论多么富有，都不能买断天庭的未来。一个政权，无论多么强大，都不能将天庭变为自己的附庸。

通过这套三十三年一次的、彻底的自我革命，天庭得以斩断可能滋生的利益连接，涤荡可能沉积的官僚习气，永远保持其作为一个服务于全人类的、去中心化公共机构的本质。

这，就是天庭能够走向千百年永续的规章。

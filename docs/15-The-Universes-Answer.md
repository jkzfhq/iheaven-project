# Chapter 15: The Universe's Answer

The story takes place in 1950 at the Los Alamos National Laboratory. One day during lunch, physicist Enrico Fermi and his colleagues were discussing the frequent UFO reports of the time and the possibility of alien existence. After a lively discussion, Fermi suddenly fell silent for a moment and then asked a question that would later become world-famous:

**"So, where is everybody?"**

Behind this question lies a vast, profound, and unsettling contradiction, known as the **Fermi Paradox**.

The logic of the paradox is as follows:

1.  **By the numbers, the universe should be teeming with life.** In our Milky Way galaxy alone, there are at least 100 billion stars. Many of them are stable and long-lived, like our sun. Recent astronomical observations have led us to believe that planets exist around almost every star. Even if only a small fraction of these planets are in the habitable zone and evolve life, the number of intelligent civilizations in the Milky Way should be enormous.
    
2.  **By the timeline, the universe is extremely old.** The universe has existed for 13.8 billion years, while our Earth is only 4.5 billion years old. This means that before we appeared, the universe had billions of years of ample time to nurture other intelligent civilizations. Some of them could have been born millions, or even hundreds of millions, of years before us.
    
3.  **By expansion, even slow civilizations should be enough to span the galaxy.** A civilization just a few million years more advanced than us would have technology we cannot imagine. But even if we assume they can only colonize interstellar space at a very slow speed, far below the speed of light (say, 1% of light speed), it would only take them a few million to a few tens of millions of years to traverse the entire Milky Way. On a cosmic timescale, this is but an instant.


Combining these three points, the obvious conclusion is that our night sky should be like a bustling interstellar metropolis, filled with the spacecraft of alien civilizations, their communication signals, and the grand engineering works of their star-modifications.

However, the reality is: **a dead silence**.

We have not detected any credible signals from alien civilizations. We have not observed any Dyson spheres or interstellar fleets. All our telescopes can see is a cold, empty universe that seems to operate silently, governed only by the laws of physics.

This is the core of the Fermi Paradox: **the irreconcilable contradiction between immense possibility and absolute silence.** So, where on earth is everybody?

To explain this unsettling silence, scientists have proposed a thought-provoking concept—**The Great Filter**.

This theory suggests that on the long road from primordial life to a super-civilization capable of interstellar colonization, there exists one or more extremely difficult, almost insurmountable hurdles. This hurdle is "The Great Filter." It acts like an invisible wall, filtering out the vast majority of potential civilizations.

Where might this Great Filter be?

-   **Possibility 1: The filter is behind us.** This is an optimistic but lonely hypothesis. It implies that the emergence of life from non-life, or the evolution from single-celled to complex life, or the leap from animals to intelligent life, is so improbable that it may have happened only once in the entire Milky Way. We are the lucky winners of the cosmic lottery; we have already passed the most difficult filter.
    
-   **Possibility 2: The filter is right in front of us.** This is an alarming hypothesis. It suggests that nearly all civilizations that develop to a technological level similar to ours end up self-destructing for some common reason. This filter could be nuclear war, runaway artificial intelligence, irreversible climate change, or some as-yet-undiscovered, inherently destructive technology. We are walking a tightrope littered with the bones of our predecessors.
    
-   **Possibility 3: The filter is ahead of us.** This is the most terrifying hypothesis. It implies that there is some kind of periodic, natural catastrophe that we currently cannot comprehend (like gamma-ray bursts from the galactic center) that regularly "cleanses" the galaxy of all complex life. Or, there exists a higher, "predator" civilization that systematically eliminates all nascent civilizations that reach a certain stage of development.


The Heavenly Court Project, for this problem, proposes a fourth possibility. An answer that is equally unsettling, yet gives us a reason to act.

Perhaps the most difficult "Great Filter" is neither the origin of life nor technological runaway, but a quieter, more internal, and more fundamental challenge—**the perpetuity of information**.

Let's imagine a civilization one million years more advanced than us. They have long since solved their energy problems and achieved interstellar travel. But they too must face the most fundamental enemy of the universe, which we discussed in the very first chapter—**increasing entropy**.

Their history, too, will be forgotten. Their knowledge, too, will be lost as storage media decay. Their society, too, will lose its initial cohesion and motivation for expansion as the "memes" are distorted and degraded through generations of transmission.

A civilization that cannot solve the problem of long-term preservation and transmission of its own information is like a giant suffering from a cosmic form of Alzheimer's disease. Even with immense power, it will, over the long course of time, gradually forget who it is, where it came from, and where it is going. It will lose its meaning of existence and eventually collapse quietly from internal chaos and disorder.

**Perhaps "the perpetuity of civilization" itself is the most difficult "Great Filter."**

Perhaps the silence of the universe is not due to a lack of life, but a lack of civilizations that can overcome "oblivion." The reason the night sky is so quiet may not be because it is a desert of life, but a graveyard of civilizations. Countless once-glorious civilizations failed to pass through this narrow gate formed by time itself, ultimately turning into undecipherable noise in the cosmic background radiation.

This is the Heavenly Court Project's answer to the Fermi Paradox.

We are building the Heavenly Court Library not just to preserve our own memories. We are attempting to create a universal toolkit capable of combating "civilizational entropy."

-   We choose **decentralization** to withstand single-point disasters, spreading the embers of information everywhere.
-   We design the **thirty-three-year epoch of Nirvana** to combat organizational sclerosis and technological obsolescence, keeping the system in a state of perpetual innovation.
-   We launch an **ark carrying the "seeds of civilization"** to overcome the fate of a single planet, backing up copies of our civilization to various corners of the universe.

Every core design of the Heavenly Court Library is intended to pass through this hypothetical, most fundamental "Great Filter."

Now, we can re-examine the silence of the universe.

It is no longer just a terrifying puzzle; it has become a solemn mission. The silence of the night sky is the ultimate reminder to all of us builders: what we are doing is the most difficult and rarest endeavor in the universe.

Every debate we have now, every line of code we write, every brick we lay, is a wager we are placing for human civilization to become the first species capable of making its own voice heard in the universe for a long time to come.

We look up at the stars and no longer feel alone. Because we know that we are, with our actions, answering Fermi's earth-shattering question.

Our answer is: **We are here. And we intend to be here forever.**

The engine is roaring, the seeds are ready, the mission is clear. Before we press the launch button, there is only one last thing to do—to pay the deepest respect to all the guardians of the First Epoch.


# 第十五章：宇宙的答案

故事发生在 1950 年的洛斯阿拉莫斯国家实验室。一天午餐时，物理学家恩里科·费米和他的同事们，正在讨论当时频繁出现的不明飞行物报导和外星人存在的可能性。在一番热烈的讨论后，费米突然沉默了片刻，然后问出了一个后来变得举世闻名的问题：

**「那么，他们都在哪儿呢？（Where is everybody?）」**

这个问题​​的背后，隐藏着一个巨大、深刻且令人不安的矛盾，这就是**费米悖论（Fermi Paradox）**。

悖论的逻辑是这样的：

1.  **从数字上看，宇宙应该是生机勃勃的。** 仅在我们的银河系中，就至少有 1000 亿颗恒星。其中很多都像我们的太阳一样，稳定而长寿。近年来​​的天文观测更是让我们相信，几乎每一颗恒星周围，都存在着行星。即使只有一小部分行星位于宜居带，并且演化出了生命，那么银河系中的智慧文明数量，也应该是一个庞大的数字。
    
2.  **从时间上看，宇宙是极其古老的。** 宇宙已经存在了 138 亿年，而我们的地球只有 45 亿年的历史。这意味着，在我们出现之前，宇宙有着长达数十亿年的充裕时间，去孕育其他的智慧文明。其中一些，可能比我们早诞生数百万年，甚至数亿年。
    
3.  **从扩张上看，即使是缓慢的文明，也足以遍布银河。** 一个比我们仅仅早熟几百万年的文明，其科技水平将是我们无法想像的。但即使我们假设他们只能以很慢的、远低于光速的速度（比如光速的 1%）进行星际殖民，他们也只需要几百万到几千万年的时间，就能够遍历整个银河系。在宇宙的时间尺度上，这只是一瞬间。


综合以上三点，一个显而易见的推论是：我们的夜空，应该像一个繁华的星际都市，充满了外星文明的飞船、通讯信号和他们改造恒星的宏伟工程。

然而，现实却是：**一片死寂**。

我们没有探测到任何来自外星文明的、可信的信号。我们没有观测到任何戴森球或星际舰队。我们的望远镜所能看到的，只是一个冰冷、空旷、似乎只有物理定律在默默运转的宇宙。

这就是费米悖论的核心：**巨大的可能性与彻底的沉默之间，存在着无法调和的矛盾。** 那么，他们到底都在哪儿呢？

为了解释这个令人不安的沉默，科学家们提出了一个发人深省的概念——**大过滤器（The Great Filter）**。

这个理论认为，在从原始生命演化到能够进行星际殖民的超级文明的漫长道路上，存在着一个或多个极其困难、几乎无法逾越的关卡。这个关卡，就是「大过滤器」。它像一堵看不见的墙，过滤掉了绝大多数的潜在文明。

这个大过滤器，可能在哪里？

- **可能性一：过滤器在我们身后。** 这是一种乐观但孤独的猜想。它意味着，生命从无到有的诞生，或者从单细胞到复杂生命的演化，又或者从动物到智慧生命的飞跃，其发生的概率是如此之低，以至于在整个银河系中，可能只有我们一次成功。我们是那个中了宇宙彩票头奖的幸运儿，我们已经通过了那个最艰难的过滤器。
    
- **可能性二：过滤器就在我们眼前。** 这是一种令人警醒的猜想。它意味着，几乎所有发展到与我们相似技术水平的文明，都会因为某些共同的原因而自我毁灭。这个过滤器可能是核战争、失控的人工智能、无法逆转的气候变化，或是某种我们尚未发现的、inherently destructive 的技术。我们正走在一条前人尸骨累累的钢丝上。
    
- **可能性三：过滤器在我们前方。** 这是一种最为可怕的猜想。它意味着，宇宙中存在着某种我们目前无法理解的、周期性的自然灾难（比如来自银河系中心的伽玛射线暴），会定期「清扫」银河系中所有复杂的生命。或者，存在着某个更高等的「猎手」文明，会系统性地消灭所有发展到一定程度的新生文明。


天庭计划，为这个问题，提出了第四种可能性。一个同样令人不安，却给了我们行动理由的答案。

或许，那个最艰难的「大过滤器」，既不是生命的诞生，也不是技术的失控，而是一个更为安静、更为内在、也更为根本的挑战——**信息的永续**。

让我们想像一个比我们早熟一百万年的文明。他们早已解决了能源问题，实现了星际航行。但他们同样要面对我们在第一章就探讨过的、宇宙最根本的敌人——**熵增**。

他们的历史，同样会被遗忘。他们的知识，同样会因为储存介质的衰败而失传。他们的社会，同样会因为代代相传中「模因」的扭曲和劣化，而失去最初的凝聚力和扩张的动力。

一个文明，如果无法解决其自身信息的长期保存和传承问题，那么它就像一个患上了宇宙级阿尔茨海默症的巨人。即使它拥有无比强大的力量，也会在漫长的时光中，逐渐忘记自己是谁，从哪里来，要到哪里去。它会失去存在的意义，最终在内部的混乱和无序中，悄然瓦解。

**或许，「文明的永续」本身，就是那个最艰难的「大过滤器」。**

或许，宇宙的沉默，不是因为缺少生命，而是因为缺少能够战胜「遗忘」的文明。夜空之所以如此安静，可能并非因为那里是一片生命的荒漠，而是一片文明的坟场。无数曾经辉煌的文明，都没能穿过这道由时间本身构成的窄门，最终化为了宇宙背景辐射中无法被解读的噪音。

这就是天庭计划对费米悖论的回答。

我们建造天庭图书馆，不仅仅是为了保存我们自己的记忆。我们是在尝试打造一套能够对抗「文明熵增」的通用工具。

- 我们选择**去中心化**，是为了抵御单点灾难，让信息的火种分布在各处。
    
- 我们设计**三十年一纪的涅槃**，是为了对抗组织的僵化和技术的过时，让系统保持永恒的革新能力。
    
- 我们发射**承载着「文明种子」的方舟**，是为了对抗单一行星的宿命，将文明的副本备份到宇宙的各个角落。


天庭图书馆的每一个核心设计，都是为了穿过这个我们假想的、最根本的「大过滤器」。

现在，我们可以重新审视宇宙的沉默了。

它不再仅仅是一个令人恐惧的谜题，它变成了一项庄严的使命。夜空的寂静，是对我们所有建造者的终极提醒：我们正在做的事情，是宇宙中最困难、也最稀有的事业。

我们此刻的每一次辩论、每一行代码、每一块砖瓦的堆砌，都是在为人类文明，成为第一个能够长久地在宇宙中发出自己声音的物种，而投下的赌注。

我们仰望星空，不再感到孤独。因为我们知道，我们正在用行动，去回答费米那个石破天惊的问题。

我们的答案是：**我们在这里。而且，我们打算永远在这里。**

引擎已经轰鸣，种子已经备好，使命已经明确。在我们按下发射按钮之前，只剩下最后一件事——向第一纪的所有守望者，致以最深的敬意。

# Conclusion: A Message for Today

Today is 2025. I am sitting in my study. Outside the window is the familiar streetscape, just like any other day.

A few years ago, during the lonely days of the pandemic lockdown, I sat right here, studying the ancient wisdom of the *I Ching* by day and gazing up at the silent starry sky by night. I don't know if it could be called a revelation; I only know that during those days of isolation, an idea broke ground in my heart, grew tenaciously, and eventually mapped out an entire galaxy of a blueprint.

This is the Heavenly Court Project. Before this, I was just an ordinary, unremarkable businessman.

This year, I am 54 years old. In the *I Ching*, the numbers six and nine combine to fifty-four, which represents the hexagram of change. Three hundred years ago, the German mathematician Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz had a sudden insight into the binary system from the yin and yang changes of the sixty-four hexagrams, ushering in our digital age. And I, at this age, have encountered the "change hexagram" of my own life. The trajectory of my life has been completely altered from this point forward.

I often close my eyes and can see visions of the future. They are not fantasies, but the path I will walk, step by step:

I see, three years from now, in a quiet corner of some city, the lights of the first Heavenly Court Library being switched on. Amidst the aroma of coffee, people will store their most precious memories into that invulnerable network.

I see, five years from now, all of us gathered together, looking up at the night sky, watching the satellite carrying the first batch of digital lives streak across the firmament, becoming a new man-made star.

I see, thirty years from now, a gray-haired me, along with a group of equally gray-haired original researchers, standing in the launch center, quietly watching "Genesis Ark I" ascend. We will have entrusted the fruits of our entire lives, along with our own digital lives, to that deeper, vaster unknown.

I know this road is long, difficult, and may not even be understood. I know I will not live to see the ark reach its destination, nor will I know the answers a hundred years from now.

But none of that matters anymore.

Since that night of awakening, my life has been reduced to one thing: to bring the Heavenly Court Project to life. From nothing to something, from zero to billions. I am no longer a businessman. I am the first, and most resolute, researcher of the Heavenly Court Institute.

This is my message for today, written to all who are reading these words at this moment:

If you too have felt a pang in your heart before a fading photograph, if you too have felt lonely while looking up at the stars, if you too believe that it is the responsibility of our generation to find a safer future for the flame of human civilization.

Then, you are welcome to join.

Our journey has only just begun today.


# 结语：今天的寄语

今天是 2025 年。我坐在书房里，窗外是熟悉的街景，一如过去的任何一天。

几年前，在疫情封控的孤独岁月里，我就是坐在这里，白天低头钻研《易经》的古老智慧，夜晚抬头仰望沉默的星空。我不知道那算不算是启示，我只知道，在那段与世隔绝的日子里，一个念头在我心底破土而出，顽强地生长，最终描绘出了一整片星系的蓝图。

这就是天庭计划。在此之前，我只是一个碌碌无为的小商人。

今年，我 54 岁。在《易经》里，六九五十四，正是变卦之数。德国数学家莱布尼茨在三百多年前，从六十四卦的阴阳变化中顿悟了二进制，开启了我们今天的数字时代。而我，在这个年纪，迎来了自己人生的「变卦」。我的人生轨迹，从此彻底改变。

我常常闭上眼睛，就能看到未来的景象，那不是幻想，而是我将要一步步走完的路：

我看见，三年后，在某个城市的安静角落，第一间天庭图书馆的灯火被点亮。人们在咖啡的香气中，将自己最珍贵的记忆，存入那个永不陷落的网络。

我看见，五年后，我们所有人聚在一起，仰望夜空，看着载有第一批数字生命的卫星，划过天际，成为一颗新的人造星辰。

我看见，三十年后，白发苍苍的我，和一群同样白发苍苍的、最初的研究员们，在发射中心里，静静地看着「创世纪方舟一号」升空。我们将自己一生的成果，连同我们自己的数字生命，一起交给了那片更深邃的未知。

我知道，这条路很长，很难，甚至可能不被理解。我知道，我将无法亲眼看到方舟抵达彼岸，也无法知晓百年之后的答案。

但这​​都不重要了。

从那个觉悟的夜晚开始，我的人生只剩下一件事：去实践天庭计划。从无到有，从零到亿。我不再是一个商人，我是天庭研究院的第一位，也是最坚定的一位研究员。

这就是我今天的寄语，写给所有在此刻，读到这些文字的人：

如果你也曾在那张褪色的照片前感到心痛，如果你也曾仰望星空感到孤独，如果你也相信，我们这一代人，有责任为人类文明的火种，寻找一个更安全的未来。

那么，欢迎你加入。

我们的旅程，今天才刚刚开始。
